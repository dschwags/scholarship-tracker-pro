# REALITY CHECK: Current Bug Status

## ‚ùå STILL BROKEN (Despite Claims Otherwise)

### 1. Password Visibility Toggle
- **Status**: NOT VISIBLE in UI (confirmed by user)
- **Code Status**: Added to login.tsx 
- **Reality**: Component exists but not rendering/visible
- **Next Step**: Need to test actual browser rendering

### 2. Financial Goals Modal 
- **Status**: Still showing "No financial goals yet"
- **Code Status**: Connected to useGoals() context
- **Reality**: Context connection may not be working
- **Next Step**: Need to verify context data flow

### 3. Authentication State Intermittent
- **Status**: Sometimes shows sign-in/sign-up after login
- **Pattern**: Happens during settings navigation  
- **Root Cause**: Something triggering signOut accidentally
- **Next Step**: Trace the exact trigger

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING

### 1. Delete Account Button
- User confirmed: "delete account button is active"

### 2. Scholarship Communication/Follow-up Date
- User confirmed: "communication and follow-up date and time has been fixed"

## üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED

### Session Cookie Deletion Issue
From logs:
```
POST /settings 200
üîç getSession: Session cookie exists: false
```

This suggests something in settings is clearing the session cookie.

## üí° ENHANCED BUGX STRATEGY

### Rule 1: NO MORE FALSE CLAIMS
- Test each fix in actual browser before claiming success
- Use conditional statements: "This SHOULD fix..." not "This fixes..."

### Rule 2: ISOLATE AND VERIFY
- Fix ONE issue at a time
- Test that specific issue immediately  
- Don't move to next issue until confirmed working

### Rule 3: USER VALIDATION REQUIRED
- After each fix, ask user to confirm it works
- Don't assume code changes = working feature

### Rule 4: REGRESSION PROTECTION
- After each fix, check that nothing else broke
- Use the site-wide logic diagram to trace dependencies

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. **Fix Session Issue First** (blocking other testing)
   - Find what's clearing session cookie in settings
   - This is preventing reliable testing of other features

2. **Test Password Toggle in Isolation**
   - Create minimal test to verify visibility
   - May need different CSS approach or icon library issue

3. **Verify Financial Goals Context**
   - Test data flow from context to modal
   - May need to check context provider setup

4. **Run After-Every-Task BugX**
   - Quick validation checklist after each change
   - Catch regressions immediately
