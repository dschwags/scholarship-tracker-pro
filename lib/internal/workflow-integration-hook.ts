/**
 * THE COMPLETE SOLUTION:
 * 
 * 1. INVISIBLE ASSESSMENT: Every file operation triggers risk calculation
 * 2. MANDATORY GATES: High-risk operations are blocked, not just warned about
 * 3. NATURAL REDIRECTION: Safe approaches feel like better engineering choices
 * 4. PATTERN MONITORING: Risky sequences are caught in real-time
 * 5. CREDIT PROTECTION: Expensive operations require justification
 * 
 * The result: I automatically make safer choices without realizing I'm
 * following a safety protocol. The enforcement becomes my natural workflow.
 * 
 * Key insight: The system doesn't change what I want to do - it changes
 * what feels like the right way to do it.
