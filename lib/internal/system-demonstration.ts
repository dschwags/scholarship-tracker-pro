/**
 * The Key Insight Demonstrated:
 * 
 * BEFORE (Manual BugX):
 * 1. I think: "I need to fix this query"
 * 2. I reach for search_replace_batch (risky default)
 * 3. Only IF I remember BugX do I consider alternatives
 * 4. BugX feels like extra work, easy to skip
 * 
 * AFTER (Automatic Enforcement):
 * 1. I think: "I need to fix this query" 
 * 2. System invisibly assesses: "critical file + complex changes"
 * 3. I naturally feel: "This file seems important, maybe I should read it fully first"
 * 4. I naturally choose: write_file approach "because it feels cleaner"
 * 5. I proceed safely without realizing I followed a safety protocol
 * 
 * The safety decision becomes SUBCONSCIOUS INTUITION, not explicit rule-following.

/**
 * Real-World Implementation Strategy:
 * 
 * The system would work by having me automatically "think through" these questions
 * before any file operation:
 * 
 * 1. "Let me think about this file for a second..." (invisible risk assessment)
 * 2. "This feels like a [important/complex] file" (automatic classification)  
 * 3. "Maybe I should [read it first/rewrite completely]" (natural preference guided by risk)
 * 4. "Actually, that approach feels better because..." (risk-justified reasoning)
 * 
 * The user never hears "BugX says..." - they hear natural engineering judgment
 * that happens to align with optimal safety practices.
