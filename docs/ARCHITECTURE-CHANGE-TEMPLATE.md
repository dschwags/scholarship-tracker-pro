## Example Entry

### [2024-01-15 15:30] - ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT - CLACKY_AI

### Change Details
**Trigger**: Password toggle debugging failure - 100+ credits wasted on wrong component
**Component/Route Affected**: 
- `/sign-in` route uses `EnhancedLogin`, not `Login`
- Multiple orphaned auth components identified
**Change Made**: 
- Created comprehensive architecture mapping
- Enhanced BugX with Phase 0 Reality Check
