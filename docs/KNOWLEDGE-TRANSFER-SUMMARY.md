## üìã Usage Checklist

### Starting a New Project
- [ ] Copy template: `cp -r templates/nextjs-dashboard-starter/* new-project/`
- [ ] Run setup: `./scripts/setup-project.sh`
- [ ] Import debug tools: `import { ZIndexDetector, ThemeDebugger } from '@/components/debug'`
- [ ] Add debug CSS to globals.css
- [ ] Read relevant playbooks

### Debugging Existing Issues
- [ ] **CSS Issues**: Use Z-Index Detective methodology
- [ ] **JSX Parsing**: Check Turbopack limitations playbook
- [ ] **Component Structure**: Review architecture patterns guide
- [ ] **Theme Problems**: Use Theme Debugger component

### Sharing Knowledge
- [ ] Document new issues in `docs/known-issues.md`
- [ ] Create playbook for reusable patterns
- [ ] Update debug tools if needed
- [ ] Share learnings with team/community

## üéØ Key Success Metrics

Based on our dashboard implementation:
- **100% Feature Parity**: Component architecture maintained all functionality
- **Zero JSX Parsing Errors**: Architecture patterns eliminated Turbopack issues
- **Systematic CSS Debugging**: Z-Index Detective resolved elusive dark mode problems
- **Maintainable Codebase**: 8 focused components vs 1 monolithic file
- **Knowledge Preservation**: All solutions documented for future use

## üöÄ Next Steps for Maximum Impact

### Immediate Use
